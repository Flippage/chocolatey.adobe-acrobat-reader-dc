# Chocolatey: Adobe Acrobat Reader DC

## Description

More powerful than other PDF software, Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is the free, trusted standard for viewing, printing, and annotating PDFs. And now, it’s connected to Adobe Document Cloud — so it’s easier than ever to work with PDFs on computers and mobile devices.

## Note

If the package fails on Windows 8.1 or earlier, this might be due to the installation of kb2919355 (which is a dependency of this package) if your system is not up-to-date. This KB requires a reboot of the system before the adobereader package installs successfully.

## Package Parameters

* `/RemoveDesktopIcons` Removes the desktop icon from Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.
* `/EnableAutoUpdate` This parameter activates the Auto Update function of Adobe Acrobat Reader.
